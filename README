Yellow Page Scraper is a library for searching various online yellow pages
providers such as switchboard.com and superpages.com.

The search method returns an array of results or an empty list.  The minimum
required arguments are keyword, city, and state (passed in that order).  The
rest of the arguments should be passed as has options 

  :provider => :switchboard
  :num_results => 10
  :num_results => :all

Currently only supports switchboard fully.  Superpages (:superpages) and
yellowpages.com (:yellowpages) are on the way.

Each result has at least the name set.  Anything missing will be set to nil.
Here is the entire list of possible data found (accessed via result.<data name>):

  url - website (often not found or some search url for the provider)
  name - business name or person's name
  phone - main phone number (sometimes they have additional numbers.  currently not getting those)
  address - main address
  city
  state
  zip - usually not there
  email
  provider - which provider was used to find the data
